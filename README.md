my idea is i will use google built in local llm ai. I want to build 

How It Works - 1. One-Time Setup: Create a Google account to carry your profile across all devices and stores. 2. Snap & Upload: Just one full-body reference photo is all you need to create your own hyper-realistic 3D body measurement. 

We go to work: We predict your measurements with stunning accuracy. You can tweak them down to the centimeter if needed.

Smart Picks: Get the perfect fit every time! we check whether you are shopping website or not? if you are on one, we check website dom component to find size, colour, size charts, reviews, etc and We analyze size charts and give you the best choiceâ€”complete with reasons why it's ideal for you based upon llm reasoning with our measurement reference.

this is just a starting point i have some better ideas on it too.

let us start to make this idea true, i have image to 3d body measurements generation api's, we need to work to build that described chrome extension from scration (from project directory), front end etc. we can use preact instead of react. but we need to design a wonderful UI too, then only it is very usable as an extension (since it is not an app, so it needs smart craft to design the usable ui)
